TASK:
Write a web app that:
* Reads a collection of data from any REST API source. It can be Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Office365 or anything you like
* Present that data on the application front-end (in HTML form), 
* Make some changes in the collection via web page
* Save the changes into JSON 
* Write JSON in a file on disk
* Bonus: Authentication with REST API source

PLAN:
* Get JSON data with basic query (get repos with more than 100000 stars) and convert it into object usable inside an app
* Starting state of the app is empty object/array
* State is populated with data from API call if needed to change inside the app, or for export
* Exported data pass through export layer to make .json file, with data from (changed) state
* Make beautiful design

PROGRESS:
* I chose GitHub, since it has good and public API
05 FEB 2020
* Started with Vanilla JS, but later converted to react-app for numerous
* Added dependencies for Bootstrap and FileSave.js, and added functionality for save to JSON file
06 FEB 2020
* Majority of work done
* Updated functions with some fields on frontend
* Decided to put JSON data into text area which also represent current state of the app
* Added filename property to be changed in the state, same for link for github api call
* Text in the text area changes state as text is changed (double binding)
07 FEB 2020
* Changed order of functions, to better resemble frontend design
* Deployed my app to github pages, link provided in the description link
* Updated this document
