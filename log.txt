Write a web application that:
* Reads a collection of data from any REST API source. It can be Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Office365 or anything you like
* Present that data on the application front-end (in HTML form), 
* Make some changes in the collection via web page
* Save the changes into JSON 
* Write JSON in a file on disk
* Bonus: Authentication with REST API source

Plan:
* Get JSON data with basic query (get repos with more than 100000 stars) and convert it into object usable inside an app
* Starting state of the app is empty object/array
* State is populated with data from API call if needed to change inside the app, or for export
* Exported data pass through export layer to make .json file, with data from (changed) state
* Make beautiful design

Progress:
* I chose GitHub, since it has good and public API
* Started with Vanilla JS, but later converted to react-app for numerous  (on 05 Feb 2020)
* Added dependencies for Bootstrap and FileSave.js, and added functionality for save to JSON file
*
