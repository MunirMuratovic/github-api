TASK:
Write a web app that:
* Reads a collection of data from any REST API source. It can be Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Office365 or anything you like
* Present that data on the application front-end (in HTML form), 
* Make some changes in the collection via web page
* Save the changes into JSON 
* Write JSON in a file on disk
* Bonus: Authentication with REST API source

PLAN:
* Get JSON data with basic query (get repos with more than 100000 stars) and convert it into object usable inside an app
* Starting state of the app is empty object/array
* State is populated with data from API call if needed to change inside the app, or for export
* Exported data pass through export layer to make .json file, with data from (changed) state
* Make beautiful design

PROGRESS:
* I chose GitHub, since it has good and public API
05 FEB 2020
* Started with Vanilla JS, but later converted to react-app for numerous
* Added dependencies for Bootstrap and FileSave.js, and added functionality for save to JSON file
06 FEB 2020
* Majority of work done
* Updated functions with some fields on frontend
* Decided to put JSON data into text area which also represent current state of the app
* Added filename property to be changed in the state, same for link for github api call
* Text in the text area changes state as text is changed (double binding)
07 FEB 2020
* Changed order of functions, to better resemble frontend design
* Deployed my app to github pages, link provided in the description link
* Updated this document

OTHER INFO:
How to deploy:
Since this is only frontend app, it can be bundled by using NPM RUN BUILD in command, which creates bundled files (html, css, js)
That can be uploaded to server (public_html folder or similar, depending on hosting provider).
I used GitHub pages for uploading live site, installing gh-pages package:
- npm install gh-pages --save-dev
- adding 3 lines of code in package.json (can be seen in commit history)
- running npm run deploy (command I previously defined)

Tools used: node.js (for it's npm - node package management), create-react-app (via npx), file-saver.js, and bootstrap.
IDE: Visual Studio Code with various extensions (snippets for JS, react etc.)
